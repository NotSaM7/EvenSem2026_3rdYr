**Scrum** is an Agile project management framework that helps teams organize and oversee their work through values, principles, and practices. Scrum encourages teams to learn through experience, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their successes and failures to continuously improve.

 Scrum is a way of managing projects, especially in software development. It's like a playbook that teams use to work together more effectively. Instead of doing everything at once, Scrum breaks work into smaller parts called "sprints." Each sprint focuses on completing a specific piece of the project, allowing teams to adapt and improve as they go. It's all about teamwork, communication, and getting things done step by step.

**What is a scrum in software development?**
Scrum is a management framework that teams use to self-organize tasks and work towards a common goal. It is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems while the productivity and creativity of delivering products are at the highest possible value. Scrum is a management framework that teams use to self-organize and work towards a common goal.
🟢Scrum allows us to develop products of the highest value while making sure that we maintain creativity and productivity.
🟢The iterative and incremental approach used in scrum allows the teams to adapt to the changing requirements.

**Silent features of Scrum**
🟢Scrum is a light-weighted framework
🟢Scrum emphasizes self-organization
🟢Scrum is simple to understand
🟢Scrum framework helps the team to work together
    
**Key Stages of Scrum**

![ScrumKey](https://github.com/anirudhagaikwad/EvenSem2026_3rdYr/blob/main/IT%20PROJECT%20MANAGEMENT%20-%2021MGH303P/Unit-1/imgs/scrum_key.png)

Key Stages of the Scrum Life Cycle:
🟢Product Backlog Creation: The Product Owner defines project goals and creates a prioritized list of features (Product Backlog).
🟢Sprint Planning: The team selects high-priority items from the Product Backlog, defines the Sprint goal, and creates a Sprint Backlog.
🟢Sprint Development (Execution): The team works on the tasks to develop a shippable product increment. Daily Scrum meetings (stand-ups) are held to discuss progress and obstacles.
🟢Sprint Review: At the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates the completed increment to stakeholders to gather feedback.
🟢Sprint Retrospective: The team reflects on the process to identify improvements for the next sprint.
🟢Release: The final product or completed functionality is released to the customer. 

This cycle repeats until the project is complete, allowing for constant adjustments and high-quality, incremental delivery

**What is Scrum Methodology?**
Here are some of the following principles and values that characterize Scrum methodology: 
Scrum Principles for Project Success
🟢Transparency: When people operate in a team setting, they are aware of the difficulties that other people may be facing. Frequent in-person meetings between project owners and members of cross-functional teams help to avoid misunderstandings and information.
🟢Reflection: The framework includes regular reflection points so that team members can assess their development. Project managers estimate and prepare for the future using the information take from these review meetings. Projects can therefore operate more effectively, on time, and within budget.
🟢Adaptation: Tasks can be rearranged in order by team members in response to evolving client needs. They choose which assignments to finish right away and which to come back to later.

**How does Scrum Work?**
Scrum divides projects into smaller, more manageable units called "sprints," which span two to four weeks on average. During these sprints, cross-functional teams work together to generate product increments that might potentially be shipped. It uses tools like the product backlog and sprint backlog, as well as regular events like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives, to promote transparency, inspection, and adaptation. In the end, this helps teams respond rapidly to changes and produce value iteratively.

**What are Scrum Artifacts?**

![ScrumArtifact](https://github.com/anirudhagaikwad/EvenSem2026_3rdYr/blob/main/IT%20PROJECT%20MANAGEMENT%20-%2021MGH303P/Unit-1/imgs/scrum_artifact.png)

There are three main agile scrum artifacts which are mentioned below:
🟢Sprint Backlog: The list of everything which the team commits to achieve in a sprint is known as Sprint Backlog. If it is developed once nobody can add to the sprint backlog except the development team.
🟢Product Backlog: The ordered list of every single thing which is needed in the product based on the product goal is known as product backlog. It is never complete, and it is always evolving.
🟢Product Increments: Lastly at the end of each sprint the development team delivers a product increment which is potentially releasable.

**What are Scrum Roles?**
![ScrumRoles](https://github.com/anirudhagaikwad/EvenSem2026_3rdYr/blob/main/IT%20PROJECT%20MANAGEMENT%20-%2021MGH303P/Unit-1/imgs/scrumRole.png)

Following are the various roles in the scrum, these are the most commonly known and used widely in the industry:
🟢Scrum Team: Scrum team is a collection of individuals from the company (typically 6-10 people) who make sure to deliver the project requirements or increments.
🟢Product Owner: The project owner represents the stakeholders and they are the ones responsible for prioritizing the backlog which ultimately leads to maximum value and team work.
🟢Scrum Master: The scrum master is an important individual who serves as a guide and mentor to make sure their team understands the scrum framework and it's values. the scrum master is highly involved dealing with day to day tasks with their team members.

**What are Sprints in Scrum?**
Whenever we build projects or products we do it in series of repetitions and these repetitions are known as sprint, sprint helps the developers of the project to build projects with higher productivity and functional. sprints are just a series of steps involved in a time-frame or duration that deals with the overall development of the product.
🟢The sprint also allows us to adapt to the changes more faster and quickly.
🟢The sprint helps creators and developers to build products faster.
🟢The sprint is a series or cycle to break down the tasks.

**What is Sprint Process?**
![ScrumSprint](https://github.com/anirudhagaikwad/EvenSem2026_3rdYr/blob/main/IT%20PROJECT%20MANAGEMENT%20-%2021MGH303P/Unit-1/imgs/ScrumCycle.png)

🟢Step 1: The scrum cycle is a complete cycle of product development which starts with the Product Owner, the product owner defines all the product backlog and requirements for further development.
🟢Step 2: The next step is handled by the scrum team and the scrum team manages the Sprint Planning in the sprint planning phase the team plans all the tasks and roles for the development of the product.
🟢Step 3: Then in the next phase the team deals with the sprint backlogs which are due and deals accordingly with all the backlogs left.
🟢Step 4: As we know the scrum master is someone who overseas all the tasks of the team and acts as a mentor for the team, so in this step the scrum master overseas and collaborates with the team to make sure the product is ready on time, this cycle typically lasts from 1 to 4 weeks but depending on the project size it varies a lot, which is why sometimes for larger projects, it's also divided into smaller part known as Daily Scrum.
🟢Step 5: This is the final process stage, in this stage the team integrates all the modules of the project and tests the various components of the product.

**Advantage of Scrum framework**
🟢Scrum framework is fast moving and money efficient.
🟢Scrum framework works by dividing the large product into small sub-products. It's like a divide and conquer strategy
🟢In Scrum customer satisfaction is very important.
🟢Scrum is adaptive in nature because it have short sprint.
🟢As Scrum framework rely on constant feedback therefore the quality of product increases in less amount of time

**Disadvantage of Scrum framework**
🟢Scrum framework do not allow changes into their sprint.
🟢Scrum framework is not fully described model. If you wanna adopt it you need to fill in the framework with your own details like Extreme Programming(XP), Kanban, Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM).
🟢It can be difficult for the Scrum to plan, structure and organize a project that lacks a clear definition.
🟢The daily Scrum meetings and frequent reviews require substantial resources.

**Applications of Scrum**
We use the scrum framework because it provides us with a flexibility and an iterative approach to do product development and whenever we do product or software development.
The scrum framework allows us to respond with the teams quickly when we have changing requirements which helps us in delivering values incrementally let's understand some common applications of scrum:

1. Software Development
    The scrum framework is popularly used in the software development field in order to manage and lever deliver software projects of small sizes as well as large and complex projects.
    We use scrum framework because it allows us to collaborate with the development team in order to work with short iterations as we have discussed before these short iterations are called sprints which lasts from two to four weeks at the end of each sprint we get a potential product.

2. Scrum in Marketing
The scrum framework can also be used in the marketing in order to manage and execute various campaigns we can use the scrum because it enables marketing professionals so that they can respond quickly to the changes of the market and according to those changes they can test different strategies and then optimise their campaigns more efficiently.

3. Social & Non Profit Sector
This framework can also be applied in the social sector as well as the non profit organization's industry to manage various projects efficiently as it allows these organisations to be more adaptive and to be more responsive to the various needs of the community that they serve which can lead to overall growth.

4. Any Complex Project
No matter what sector we are working on the scrum is suitable for any project that deals with complex requirements which are changing with time because when we are working with the product that has changing requirements then using an incremental approach is always beneficial.

5. R&D (Research and Development Sector)
The scrum framework is useful in under industries where we have the work of research and development as we can use the scrum framework to manage ongoing projects and prioritise them accordingly as we manage and prioritise various products and projects it will allow the team of development and researchers to experiment and adapt various approach based on feedback that they receive regularly.
