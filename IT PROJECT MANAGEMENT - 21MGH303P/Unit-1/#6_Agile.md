**What is Agile?**
Agile is a Project Management and software development approach that aims to be more effective.
🟢It focuses on delivering smaller pieces of work regularly instead of one big launch.
🟢This allows teams to adapt to changes quickly and provide customer value faster.
🟢Agile is not just a methodology; it’s a mindset. Agile isn't about following specific rituals or techniques. Instead, it's a bunch of methods that show a dedication to quick feedback and always getting better.

**What is the Agile Methodology?**
Agile methodology is a way of managing projects that breaks work into small, manageable cycles, commonly known as sprints. It’s an iterative process in which teams set goals for each sprint, then build, test, and review their work with stakeholders before moving to the next sprint. After every sprint, teams reflect and look back to see if anything could be improved. Regular feedback helps teams adapt to change, deliver results sooner, and better fulfil customer need

**History of Agile**
🟢In 1957, people started figuring out new ways to build computer programs. They wanted to make the process better over time, so they came up with iterative and incremental methods.
🟢In the 1970s, people started using adaptive software development and evolutionary project management. This means they were adjusting and evolving how they built software.
🟢In 1990s, there was a big change. Some people didn't like the strict and super-planned ways of doing things in software development. They called these old ways "waterfall." So, in response, lighter and more flexible methods showed up. 

**Agile key concepts every team should know**
🟢Agile: A project management approach that delivers high-quality work in small increments rather than in one final release.
🟢Sprint: A short work cycle, usually one to four weeks, where teams commit to completing specific tasks.
🟢Product backlog: A prioritized list of features, fixes, and tasks that guide what the team will work on next.
🟢Sprint backlog: The selected items from the product backlog that the team plans to finish during a sprint.
🟢Standup: A short daily meeting where team members share progress, plans, and roadblocks.
🟢Iteration: A repeated cycle of planning, building, testing, and reviewing work to improve outcomes.
🟢User story: A brief explanation of a feature from the end user's perspective, often used to define requirements.
🟢Epic: A large work item made up of multiple user stories that span several sprints.
🟢Velocity: A metric showing how much work a team completes in a sprint, often measured in story points.
🟢Burndown chart: A visual tool that tracks remaining work against the time left in a sprint or project.
🟢Work in progress (WIP): The tasks currently being worked on; limiting WIP helps prevent bottlenecks and delays.

**What is the Agile Manifesto?**
The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is a document that details the four values and 12 principles for Agile software development. It was published in February 2001 by 17 software developers who needed an alternative to the more linear product development process. It prioritizes people, working solutions, customer collaboration, and the ability to respond to change over rigid plans, heavy documentation, and strict processes. These values shape how Agile teams work, make decisions, and measure progress.

**What are the 12 Agile Principles?**
![Agile-Principles](https://github.com/anirudhagaikwad/EvenSem2026_3rdYr/blob/main/IT%20PROJECT%20MANAGEMENT%20-%2021MGH303P/Unit-1/imgs/Agile12_Principals.png)

There are 12 Agile Principles mentioned in the Agile Manifesto. Agile principles are guidelines for flexible and efficient software development. They emphasize frequent delivery, embracing change, collaboration, and continuous improvement. The focus is on delivering value, maintaining a sustainable work pace, and ensuring technical excellence.
🟢Satisfy customers through early, continuous improvement and delivery. When customers receive new updates regularly, they're more likely to see the changes they want in the product. This leads to happier, more satisfied customers and more recurring revenue.
🟢Welcome changing requirements, even late in the project. The Agile framework is all about adaptability. In iterative approaches like Agile, being inflexible causes more harm than good. 
🟢Deliver value frequently. Similar to principle #1, continuous delivery of value to your customers or stakeholders often reduces churn. 
🟢Break the silos of your projects. Cross-functional teams and collaboration are key Agile values. The goal is for people to break out of their individual projects and collaborate more frequently. 
🟢Build projects around motivated individuals. Agile management works best when teams are committed and actively working to achieve a goal. 
🟢The most effective way to communicate is face-to-face. If you’re working on a distributed team, spend time communicating face-to-face, like on Zoom calls or during daily stand-up meetings. 
🟢Working software is the primary measure of progress. The ultimate goal of software development projects is a working product, and the Agile framework supports this by prioritizing functional software above all.
🟢Maintain a sustainable working pace. Some aspects of Agile project management can be fast-paced, but it shouldn't be so fast that team members burn out. The goal is to maintain sustainability throughout the development process.
🟢Continuous excellence enhances agility. If the team develops excellent code in one sprint, they can continue building on it the next. Continually creating great work allows teams to move faster in the future. 
🟢Simplicity is essential. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution. Agile development aims to not overcomplicate things and find simple answers to complex problems. 
🟢Self-organizing teams generate the most value. Similar to principle #5, proactive teams become valuable assets to the company as they strive to deliver continuous improvement
🟢Regularly reflect and adjust your way of working to improve effectiveness. Retrospective meetings are a common Agile practice. It's a dedicated time for Agile teams to reflect on their performance and adapt their behaviors for the future.

**What are the 4 pillars of Agile?**
As outlined in the Agile Manifesto, there are four main principles of Agile project management:
🟢Individuals over processes and tools. Agile teams value team collaboration and teamwork over working independently and doing things "by the book.”
🟢Working software over comprehensive documentation. The software that Agile teams develop should work. Additional work, like documentation, is not as important as developing good software.
🟢Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Customers are extremely important within the Agile methodology. Agile teams allow customers to guide where the software should go. Therefore, customer collaboration is more important than the finer details of contract negotiation.
🟢Responding to change over following a plan. One of the major benefits of Agile project management is its flexibility. Agile enables teams to quickly shift strategies and workflows without derailing an entire project.

**1. Requirement Gathering**
    In this stage, the project team identifies and documents the needs and expectations of various stakeholders, including clients, users, and subject matter experts.
    It involves defining the Project's Scope, objectives, and requirements.
    Establishing a budget and schedule.
    Creating a project plan and allocating resources.

**2. Design**
    Developing a high-level system architecture.
    Creating detailed specifications, which include data structures, algorithms, and interfaces.
    Planning for the software's user interface.

**3. Development (Coding)**
    Writing the actual code for the software.
    Conducting unit testing to verify the functionality of individual components.

**4. Testing**
This phase involves several types of testing:
    Integration Testing: Ensuring that different components work together.
    System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole.
    User Acceptance Testing: Confirming that the software meets user requirements.
    Performance Testing: Assessing the system's speed, scalability, and stability.

**Types of Agile Methodologies**
Agile is a flexible framework with several approaches, each suited for different project needs. Here are some of the most common Agile methodologies:

**1. Kanban**
Kanban Method is an approach to evolutionary and incremental systems and process change for organizations. A work-in-progress limited pull system is the central mechanism to uncover system operation (or process) complications and encourage collaboration to continuously improve the system.
Kanban is best suited in the below scenarios:
    Dynamic/ frequent changing requirements which need to be delivered faster.
    In case of changing priorities, the team can pull the prioritized work as soon as the WIP limit drops.
    Frequent releases are there (Periodically).
    When incoming work is continuous.

**2. Scrum**
Scrum is great for small teams and works in sprints—short, focused work periods. A Scrum Master removes obstacles for the team. Scrum includes two key events:
    Sprint Planning: Decides what the team will work on in the next sprint.
    Sprint Retrospective: Reflects on the last sprint to improve the process for the next one.

**3. Extreme Programming (XP)**
Extreme Programming (XP) focuses on technical practices and rapid delivery. It emphasizes values like communication, simplicity, feedback, courage, and respect. XP helps teams release updates frequently, making it ideal for projects where customer feedback and fast changes are crucial.

**4. Adaptive Project Framework (APF)**
Adaptive Project Framework (APF) is designed for projects where things can change unexpectedly. It's often used in IT projects where traditional methods may not apply. APF focuses on adapting to changes in resources, budgets, timelines, or team members as the project progresses.

**5. Extreme Project Management (XPM)**
Extreme Project Management (XPM) is used for complex projects with a lot of uncertainty. It’s highly flexible, allowing teams to constantly adjust their processes and strategies. XPM involves short sprints for rapid problem-solving and adjusting approaches as needed.

**6. Adaptive Software Development (ASD)**
Adaptive Software Development (ASD) is about continuous learning and adaptation. The three main phases are:
    Speculate: Develop ideas about how the project should progress.
    Collaborate: Work closely with the team and customers.
    Learn: Use feedback to improve and make better decisions.
    This approach is fluid, allowing teams to work through all phases simultaneously and adjust quickly.

**7. Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)**
Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) is more structured and covers the entire project lifecycle. It includes four main phases:
    Feasibility and Business Study: Understand the project’s goals and its feasibility.
    Functional Mode or Prototype Iteration: Build prototypes to refine the solution.
    Design and Build Iteration: Develop the final solution.
    Implementation: Deliver the completed product.
    DSDM is ideal for projects needing a solid structure while still maintaining flexibility.

**8. Feature Driven Development (FDD)**
Feature Driven Development (FDD) focuses on developing specific features. The team works on one feature at a time, delivering regular updates based on customer feedback. It allows for fast fixes and frequent progress, keeping the project moving forward.

**When to use the Agile Methodology?**
If you want to know When to Use the Agile Methodology, then it is particularly well-suited for projects and organizations where the following conditions or needs are present:
🟢Unclear or Changing Requirements: Agile is great for projects with requirements that aren't well-defined or might change.
🟢Complex Projects: It's good for big, complex projects by breaking them into smaller pieces.
🟢Customer Focus: Use Agile when making customers happy is a priority and you want to involve them throughout.
🟢Quick Time-to-Market: If you need to get your product out fast, Agile can help.
🟢Small to Medium Teams: Agile works well for teams of a few to a few dozen people.
🟢Team Skills: It's best when you have a mix of skills in your team, like development, testing, design, and more.
🟢Collaboration: Agile promotes working together and open communication.
🟢Regular Updates: If you want to check progress often and make changes as needed.
🟢Transparency: Agile emphasizes being open and clear with everyone involved in the project.
🟢Risk Control: It helps manage risks by tackling issues as they come up.
🟢Innovation: If you encourage trying new things and learning from experience, Agile supports that.
🟢Continuous Improvement: Agile fosters a culture of always getting better over time.

**Agile Terminologies** 

🟢Agile Software Development
Agile Software Development is a software development methodology that values flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It is based on the Agile Manifesto, a set of principles for software development that prioritize individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.

🟢Agile Development Models
The Agile Development Model was primarily designed to help a project adapt quickly to change requests. So, the main aim of the Agile model is to facilitate quick project completion. To accomplish this task, agility is required. Agility is achieved by fitting the process to the project and removing activities that may not be essential for a specific project. Also, anything that is a waste of time and effort is avoided. 
The Agile Model refers to a group of development processes. These processes share some basic characteristics but do have certain subtle differences among themselves.
Agile Software Development Methodology

🟢Agile Software Development Methodology 
in software development is an efficient methodology that helps teams produce high-quality software quickly and with flexibility. Agile is not just a methodology; it’s a mindset. At its core, Agile values individuals and interactions, working solutions, and customer collaboration over strict processes and comprehensive documentation. It acknowledges that the needs and priorities of a project may change, emphasizing the importance of adaptability and continuous improvement.

🟢What is Agile Product Management?
In simple terms, Agile Product Management is a concept and approach that focuses on speed while taking the demands of customers into account throughout the product development life cycle. As compared to traditional Waterfall approaches, which follow a ‘linear and sequential’ process, Agile uses iterative cycles of operation; developers can return to customers for feedback or modifications constantly. That is a mindset that prioritizes people and interactions over processes and systems, working products over detailed documentation, and customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

🟢What is Agile Project Management?
Agile Project Management is a revolutionary approach, that is aimed at continuously delivering solutions for the changing requirements of the project in a spiral way.
    It was established by the Agile Manifesto’s principles, calling for iterative and incremental development of the project into manageable sprints that create potentially shippable increments.
    Agile Project Management is the concept of being agile and agile method in the new challenges of advanced projects, concerning its community-oriented spirit, planning flexibility, and ongoing progress.

🟢Agile Software Testing
Agile Testing is a Type of Software Testing that follows the principles of agile software development to test the software application. All members of the project team along with the special experts and testers are involved in agile testing. Agile testing is not a separate phase and it is carried out with all the development phases i.e. requirements, design and coding, and test case generation.
