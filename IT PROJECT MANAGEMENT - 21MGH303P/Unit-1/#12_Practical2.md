# Practical 2: Project Identification Process Methodology and Stakeholder Description

## Objective
To learn the methodology for identifying potential software projects and describing stakeholders. This ensures projects are viable and stakeholders are clearly defined for better communication.

## Tools/Materials Needed
- Mind mapping tools (e.g., MindMeister, XMind, or paper sketches).
- Stakeholder analysis templates (Excel or Google Sheets).
- Brainstorming sessions.

## Theoretical Background
Project identification involves selecting ideas based on feasibility, market need, and alignment with goals. Methodology includes problem identification, opportunity analysis, and selection criteria. Stakeholder description maps roles, interests, and influence.

## Procedure
1. **Brainstorm Project Ideas:** Identify problems or opportunities.
2. **Apply Methodology:** Use steps like SWOT analysis or feasibility study.
3. **Select Project:** Evaluate based on criteria (cost, benefit, risk).
4. **Describe Stakeholders:** Create profiles with roles, expectations, and power/interest grid.
5. **Document:** Summarize in a report.

## Sample Project Example
Hypothetical project: "EcoTrack" – An app to track personal carbon footprint.

### Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Project Identification Methodology:**
   - **Step 1: Problem/Opportunity Identification:** Environmental awareness is rising; people need tools to monitor daily carbon emissions (e.g., from travel, food).
   - **Step 2: Feasibility Analysis:** Technical (possible with APIs for data), Economic (low development cost), Operational (user-friendly UI).
   - **Step 3: Selection Criteria:** High market potential, low risk, aligns with sustainability goals.
   - **SWOT Analysis:**
     - Strengths: Unique features like real-time tracking.
     - Weaknesses: Data privacy concerns.
     - Opportunities: Partnerships with eco-brands.
     - Threats: Competitor apps like MyCarbon.

2. **Stakeholder Description:**
   - **Mapping Technique:** Use Power/Interest Grid.
     - High Power/High Interest: Investors – Keep satisfied by showing ROI.
     - High Power/Low Interest: Regulators – Monitor for compliance.
     - Low Power/High Interest: End-users – Consult regularly.
     - Low Power/Low Interest: General public – Inform via marketing.

3. **Detailed Stakeholder Profiles:**
   - **End-Users:** Individuals aged 18-35 interested in sustainability; Expectations: Easy-to-use app; Influence: Feedback drives features.
   - **Developers:** Tech team; Roles: Build and maintain; Interests: Timely requirements.
   - **Clients/Sponsors:** Environmental NGO; Expectations: Free basic version; Power: Funding approval.

## Output/Results
Stakeholder Description Table:

| Stakeholder | Role | Interests | Influence Level | Expectations |
|-------------|------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| End-Users | Primary users | Sustainability tracking | Medium | Intuitive UI, accurate data |
| Developers | Builders | Clear specs | High (technical) | Realistic timelines |
| Sponsors | Funders | Project success | High | Measurable impact on environment |

Project Selection Report: "EcoTrack selected due to high demand in green tech market and feasible implementation within 6 months."

## Conclusion
This practical highlights how structured methodology avoids poor project choices. In practice, involve real stakeholders early. Challenges: Balancing conflicting interests.
