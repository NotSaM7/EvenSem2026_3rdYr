The **Software Development Life Cycle** (SDLC) is a structured framework used by software organizations to design, develop, and test high-quality software. It defines the entire process of software production, from the initial idea to the final deployment and maintenance.

The goal of the SDLC is to produce high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within time and cost estimates, and is efficient to maintain.

**Phase 1 - Planning**
First, this phase of the software development lifecycle is planning. This phase involves defining the project, determining the goals, objectives and Identifying the resources required. The planning phase sets the foundation for the entire software development project. Moreover, it is crucial to get it right.
In the planning phase, the following activities take place:-
🟢Gathering requirements from clients
🟢Defining the project
🟢Identifying project goals and objectives
🟢Creating a project plan
🟢Allocating resources

**Phase 2 - Analysis**
Second, this phase of the software development lifecycle is analysis. In this phase, they analyzed the requirements gathered in the planning phase to determine the feasibility of the project. On the other hand, the analysis phase helps to identify any potential challenges or issues that may arise during the software development process.
In the analysis phase, the following activities take place:-
🟢Analyzing the gathered requirements
🟢Identifying potential challenges and issues
🟢Developing a detailed project plan
🟢Creating a functional specification document
🟢Identifying any third-party tools or technologies required

**Phase 3 - Design**
The third phase of the software development lifecycle is design. In this phase, we create the software design based on the requirements gathered in the planning phase and the functional specification document created in the analysis phase. Again, the design phase helps to ensure that the software meets the clients is of high quality.
In the design phase, the following activities take place:-

🟢Creating a detailed software design
🟢Identifying any potential design issues or challenges
🟢Developing a user interface design
🟢Creating a database schema
🟢Identifying any required software technology

**Phase 4 - Development**
The fourth phase of the software development lifecycle is development. In addition, the Design and development of SDLC is we develop the software based on the design created in the previous phase. Moreover, the development phase is the most time-consuming phase of the software development technique , it involves writing code, testing, and debugging.
In the development phase, the following activities take place:-
🟢Writing code
🟢Testing the software
🟢Debugging
🟢Creating user manuals and technical documentation
🟢Conducting performance testing

**Phase 5 - Testing**
Fifth phase of the software development lifecycle is testing. In this phase, we test the software to ensure that it meets the clients and is of high quality. Additionally, the testing phase helps to identify any defects or issues with the software, which are then fixed before we release the software.
In the testing phase, the following activities take place:-
🟢Functional testing
🟢System testing
🟢Integration testing
🟢Acceptance testing
🟢Regression testing

**Phase 6 - Deployment**
The sixth phase of the software development lifecycle is deployment. In this phase, we deploy the software to the production environment. The deployment phase involves a series of tasks to ensure that the software is ready for release and that the end users can use it. Even so,the deployment phase is a critical phase of the software development lifecycle, as it determines the success of the project.
In the deployment phase, the following activities take place:-
🟢Preparing the software for release
🟢Creating installation packages
🟢Deploying the software to the production environment
🟢Conducting user acceptance testing
🟢Providing training to end-users

**Phase 7 - Maintenance**
Ultimately, the final phase of the software development lifecycle is maintenance. This phase, often referred to as software maintenance, plays a critical role in ensuring the application remains effective and aligned with evolving user needs. To better understand what is software maintenance, it involves fixing defects, improving performance, and updating the software to stay compatible with new technologies or business requirements.
In the maintenance phase, the following activities take place:-
🟢Monitoring the software
🟢Conducting maintenance activities
🟢Fixing defects or issues with the software
🟢Enhancing the software based on feedback from clients
🟢Providing technical support to end-users

**Why is SDLC Important?**
Without a structured SDLC, software development becomes chaotic. Teams may miss requirements, blow budgets, or deliver buggy code that doesn't solve the user's problem. SDLC provides:
🟢Visibility: Stakeholders know exactly what is happening at every stage.
🟢Quality Control: Testing is integrated into the process, not an afterthought.
🟢Risk Management: Potential pitfalls are identified during the planning phase.
🟢Cost Estimation: Helps in predicting timelines and budgets accurately.

**Popular SDLC Models**
Organizations choose a model based on their project's complexity and flexibility needs: 
🟢Waterfall Model: A linear, sequential approach where each phase must be finished before the next begins. Best for projects with stable requirements.
🟢Agile Model: An iterative process that breaks development into small "sprints" (2-4 weeks). It emphasizes continuous feedback and adaptability.
🟢Spiral Model: Focuses heavily on risk assessment. The project passes through repeating cycles of planning, risk analysis, and engineering.
🟢V-Model: An extension of Waterfall where a testing phase is paired with every development phase for better early-stage defect detection.
🟢DevOps: Merges development and operations into a continuous cycle of building, testing, and releasing via automated CI/CD pipelines
