### Practical 4: Market Demand Analysis and Demand Planning

## Objective
To analyze market demand for a software product and plan accordingly, ensuring the project meets real-world needs and has commercial potential.

## Tools/Materials Needed
- Survey tools (Google Forms, SurveyMonkey).
- Data analysis software (Excel, Google Sheets).
- Market research resources (free reports from Statista or Google Trends).

## Theoretical Background
Market analysis examines competitors and trends; demand analysis forecasts user needs using quantitative (surveys) and qualitative (interviews) methods. Planning involves estimating demand and adjusting project scope.

## Procedure
1. **Market Research:** Analyze competitors and trends.
2. **Demand Elicitation:** Collect data via surveys/focus groups.
3. **Analyze Data:** Use stats to forecast.
4. **Plan Demand:** Set targets for users/revenue.
5. **Report:** Summarize findings and recommendations.

## Sample Project Example
"EcoTrack" app from Practical 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Market Analysis:**
   - Competitors: Apps like CarbonFootprint Calculator.
   - Trends: Rising eco-consciousness (e.g., Google Trends shows +50% searches for "carbon tracker" in 2025).
   - SWOT: Opportunity in mobile integration.

2. **Demand Elicitation:**
   - Surveyed 50 people: 70% interested in tracking emissions; 40% willing to pay $2/month.
   - Focus Group: 10 participants highlighted need for gamification.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Quantitative: Potential users = 1 million (based on similar apps' downloads).
   - Qualitative: High demand in urban areas like Gurugram.
   - Forecast: Year 1 demand = 100,000 downloads.

4. **Demand Planning:**
   - Targets: 50,000 free users, 10,000 paid.
   - Adjustments: Add features based on survey (e.g., social sharing).
   - Risk: Low demand if economy dips – Mitigate with marketing.

## Output/Results
Demand Forecast Table:

| Year | Estimated Downloads | Revenue Projection ($2/sub) |
|------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1    | 100,000             | $240,000 (10% paid)        |
| 2    | 200,000             | $480,000                   |

Chart Suggestion: Use Excel to plot trends.

## Conclusion
This practical shows demand drives project success. In Gurugram's tech hub, focus on local trends. Challenges: Biased survey data – Use diverse samples.
