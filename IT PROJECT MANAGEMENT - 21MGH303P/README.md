- 20% Unit tests + 20% Report & Viva → Focus on understanding + application

## 2. Why This Subject is Required? (Super Important for Your Career in 2026!)

Most B.Tech/M.Tech students are excellent at **writing code**, but the bitter truth is:

> **Great code + Poor management = Failed product**  
> **Average code + Excellent management = Successful product**

### Latest Industry Reality Check (2024–2025 Data)

- According to recent **Standish Group CHAOS** studies and PMI Pulse reports, even in 2025:  
  - Only ~30% of IT/software projects are fully successful (on time, on budget, with expected features)  
  - ~20–50% fail completely or are significantly challenged  
  - Common reasons: poor requirements, scope creep, bad risk management, unrealistic schedules, weak communication  

- **PMI Pulse of the Profession 2025** highlights:  
  - Hybrid & Agile approaches are winning — pure Waterfall is declining  
  - Projects with strong decision-making & risk management achieve **63% success rate** vs **18%** for weak teams  

- **Global IT spending** is projected to hit ~$5.43 trillion in 2025 — companies desperately need professionals who can **deliver value** without wasting millions.

**Bottom line for you as a student in 2026:**  
If you only know coding → you compete with millions of freshers.  
If you also know **how to deliver entire projects successfully** → you become the rare candidate companies fight for (higher packages, faster promotions, leadership roles).

## 3. Extreme Importance of IT Project Management for Software Engineers (2026 Perspective)

- Prevents **wasted effort** — early risk detection saves 10× cost compared to fixing later  
- Handles **constant change** — clients change requirements every week in real projects  
- Improves **team happiness** — clear roles, daily standups, retrospectives reduce burnout  
- Bridges **tech vs business** gap — you speak both languages  
- Enables **faster delivery** — Agile/Scrum → releases every 2 weeks instead of 1–2 years  
- **Career accelerator** — Freshers with PM + Agile knowledge get roles like:  
  • Technical Project Coordinator  
  • Scrum Master (entry-level)  
  • Agile Delivery Engineer  
  → Packages 20–40% higher than pure developers in top companies

## 4. Real-World Project Examples (Success & Failure Lessons – 2024/2025)

### Huge Success Stories with Agile/Scrum

- **Spotify** (ongoing model) — Squads, Tribes, Guilds using Scrum at massive scale → Continuous deployment, super-fast innovation  
- **BBVA Bank** (mobile app revolution) — Adopted Scrum teams in 2014–2025 → Launched successful mobile banking app, inspired digital factories across the bank  
- **LEGO Digital** — Transformed from waterfall → Scrum teams → Much faster product releases & innovation  
- **Philips Healthcare** — Used Scrum for EHR systems → Frequent feedback from doctors → Better quality & adoption  
- **Bosch Automotive** → Adopted Scrum in 2018–2025 → Became more innovative in electric/autonomous vehicle software  

### Famous Failures (What NOT to Do)

- Early **Healthcare.gov** (USA) — Poor scope & risk management → Billions wasted, massive delays  
- Many startup MVPs → Scope creep + no proper backlog grooming → Product never launches properly  

**Key Lesson:**  
**Management discipline** turns good ideas into market-winning products. This course teaches exactly that discipline!
